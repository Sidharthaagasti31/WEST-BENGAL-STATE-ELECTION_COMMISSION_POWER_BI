# WEST-BENGAL-STATE-ELECTION_COMMISSION_POWER_BI

### Overview:
This project focuses on web scraping data from the West Bengal Election Commission website for Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samity elections. The scraped data will be cleaned and analyzed using Pandas for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Additionally, a Power BI dashboard will be created to visualize the insights and key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Introduction
The West Bengal Election Commission regularly publishes election-related data on its website. This project aims to scrape the data for Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samity elections, clean the data using Pandas, and perform EDA to gain insights into the election process and candidate information.



### Requirements
To run the web scraping and analysis code, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- Selenium
- Pandas
- Power BI (for creating the dashboard)
Make sure to install these dependencies before running the code.



### Web Scraping
The web scraping code is written in Python and uses Selenium to extract data from the provided [links](https://portal.wbsec.org/) of the West Bengal Election Commission website. The data will be retrieved for all the candidates participating in the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samity elections.

### Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, the next step is to clean it using Pandas. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data into appropriate formats. Cleaning the data ensures that it is ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA will be performed using Pandas and various data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. The analysis will include candidate demographics, party affiliations, vote distributions, and any other relevant insights obtained from the data.

### Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard will be created to present the findings in a visually appealing and interactive format. The dashboard will consist of 10 insightful visualizations and 3 key performance indicators (KPIs) that summarize the election data.
